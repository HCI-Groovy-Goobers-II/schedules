# Deliverable 2 Schedule

## 2/20

### Meeting
- Retrospective
    + Decided no Trello board for this deliverable; unnecessary rn.
- Divide the work, Assess schedule
    + Done
- Consider platforms, frameworks for developing the solution (for future deliverables)
    + Considering Django, ASP.NET Core MVC. Wordpress probably inadequate. Others like Vue.js and React are possibilities.
