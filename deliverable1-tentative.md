## 1/30

### First Meeting

- Short Introductions
- Explore who wants to do what; define roles
- Go around and listen to everyone's ideas for solutions we could design
- Decide on ONE idea so we can begin working
- Get everyone on Github (or Bitbucket if we'd rather do that)
------------------------------------------------------

## 1/31-2/3

Let's try to get a start on the project no later than Thursday, 2/3.

### Project Proposal [Ashley: 1-2] [Ryan: 3-4]

Start on the following steps of the project proposal:
1) The problem we chose
2) Target Users
3) Solution: The interface we envision and how it will address the problem
4) Roles and Tasks

### Analysis: User Analysis [Josh]

Start on the user personas.

*Remember to provide the people who work on this with Elyssa's personas.*

Define at least 3 primary users and make graphic personas for each.

### Tasks: Task scenarios [Ashley] [Brandon]

The spec says to write 1 para. task scenario for each of the 5+ tasks identified but in the second step we have to describe 6 tasks. Makes more sense to me to write about 6 task scenarios so they pair 1:1 with the second part.

- Person 1, Person 4 begin on writing the task scenarios.

### Tasks: Tasks (formal descriptions) [Amber]

Begin the second part of the Task Analysis. Write the goal, preconditions, postconditions, and subtasks.

*You will probably have to wait for Person 1 and Person 4 to write some, so what you write lines up with what they have described.*

------------------------------------------------------

## 2/6

Sunday, 2/6 -- Good day to have a meeting. Check in to see where everyone is at. See who can help someone, if needed, and such.

------------------------------------------------------

## 2/7

### Project Proposal [Ashley: 1-2] [Ryan: 3-4]

By this date (Monday), have the project proposal document finished.

### Analysis: User Analysis [Josh]

By this date (Monday), have the personas finished.

### Tasks: Task scenarios [Ryan] [Brandon]

By this date (Monday), have the task scenarios finished.

### Tasks: Tasks (formal descriptions) [Amber]

------------------------------------------------------

## 2/7-2/9

Basically at this point, we should have a first draft of everything done.

Therefore, let's use this time to check our grammar and style and look for improvements. Make sure we have met all the specs.

------------------------------------------------------

## 2/10

Hopefully just be done :D


Thursday, 2/10: Let's see if we're all cool turning our stuff in assuming its in good condition. Maybe check the specs once more to make sure we didn't overlook something.
