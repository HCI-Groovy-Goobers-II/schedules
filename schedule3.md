# Deliverable 3 Schedule

## Wednesday, 3/23

### Trello Setup

- Set up the Trello board for this sprint so people can self-assign tasks/stories.
- Considerations: Epics, fine-grained stories, tasks, point-estimation Scrum power-up.

## Thursday, 3/24

### Usability Questions

- Write the 6 usability questions (they should be testable) in our shared report document (see the example report for reference).

### User Stories

- Write the four user stories in our shared report document (see the example report for reference).

### App Setup

- Begin setting up the application solution/package/whatever.
	-- Be able to launch the index page in the web browser.
	
## Friday, 3/25

### App Setup

- Continue app setup by getting some basic routing/controller functions so that the index/home page, the login page, and the register page can be accessed (login and register don't necessarily need to work at this point).

## 3/25-3/30

### App Development: Basics

- Continue app development by getting working login and registration.
	-- Consider business rules (university email address) and  fields needed for a professor user and a student user entity.

### App Development: Professor Side

- Start defining the functionality needed for a professor to create classes (1:M relationship from class entity to user entity) and teams (1:M relationship from team entity to class entities).

- Considerations: Might need do draft ERD before making models. Need a frontend person working on the views for the creation of classes and teams.

## 3/30-4/3

### App Development: Professor Side

- Complete the functionality for professor to create classes and teams.

### App Development: Student Side

- Get started on the student side: after a student logs in, they should see some version of the student search screen. so they can filter through students by ratings, etc.

- Considerations: We may have to add features to our prototyped search page (could have a linked list of user's classes, majors on right side that will open a view of all students in selected class or major ).
	
## 4/3-4/7

### App Development: Student Side

- Finish development on student side: being able to search, filter and view student ratings.

- Considerations: May want to add some views/functionality for students to set profile images, customize name, gender/pronouns.

- By the 7th, we should have successfully implemented all the required functionality and views for this deliverable (we may not have ability to issue peer evaluations or student's ability to use peer evaluations yet, of course).

## Thurs,4/7-Fri, 4/8

### Usability Testing

- We need to have all our usability testing done on by the Friday the 8th so we can get this stuff wrapped up.
	-- Will probably talk to professor long before this date to make sure we understand how this is supposed to work.
