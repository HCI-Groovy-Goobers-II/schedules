| Category                   | Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Recommendations                                                                                                                      | Severity | Effort to Implement | Reason to Implement                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Navigation                 | The "browse by" button was difficult to notice.  One participant did not notice it was there initially and took alternate paths to accomplish tasks best served by its functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Change the design of the button to look more like a clickable interface.  Possibilities include changing shape, contrast, and color. | High     | Low                 | Functionality is not effective if it is not noticed.                                                                                      |
| Content / Navigation       | Tagging was a feature expected but missing/lacking content. Participants felt that tagging would allow for less specific searches and dynamic categorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Implement a tagging library and content to add additional fields to search through.                                                  | Low      | Medium              | Adding expected features allows for more user comfort when searching for content, especially if the object of the search is fuzzy.        |
| Search                     | The search bar will only auto-complete titles.  One participant interpreted this to mean that only titles could be searched through on the main search bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Expand the fields included in auto-complete to include more than titles.                                                             | Medium   | Low                 | Reducing user confusion is always a good thing, especially if the effort required is minimal.                                             |
| Create Account / Technical | One participant's "Create Account" Pop-Up box was buggy. During one of the sessions, the user was attempting to complete Task #3 and was unable to complete the task because the text in the pop-up box did not appear. Therefore, the participant was unable to fill in the required fields and failed the task. This also led to the failure of Task #4, as the task required them to already have a password. | More testing. Test the site in every browser, under every condition before moving on to usability testing.                           | High     | Medium              | Testing the site beforehand is crucial. The account creation itself is a central portion of the site and it should be guaranteed to work. |
| Technical                  | In Internet Explorer 8.0, the functionality for the "Browse By" dropdown menu was broken. Before the usability testing began, the testers realized the "browse by" tab would not drop down when clicked in this browser. Therefore, we performed the usability testing in Mozilla Firefox, where it functioned just fine.                                                                                        | More testing. Test the site in every browser, under every condition before moving on to usability testing.                           | High     | Medium              | Testing the site beforehand is crucial. The "Browse By" advanced search is also a central portion of the usability of the site.           |
